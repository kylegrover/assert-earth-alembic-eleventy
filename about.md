title: Who We Are
---
ASSERT, short for Animal Safety & Survival Emergency Response Team, is a community based organization focused on picking up where our brave first-responders leave off. As "second responders", we wait for firefighters to clear an area of danger, then when we're called upon we come in to restore the land and feed and water both the wildlife and any pets or other domestic animals that residents didn't get to evacuate.

## Formed Out of Necessity

ASSERT started with Ryan Okrant's efforts to help rehabilitate his home town of Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County's San Lorenzo Valley, after devastating fires swept the area beginning in August. Ryan noticed a weakness in our fire response system, and an opportunity to help out by getting involved and coordinating others who want to help out.
