feature_text: Help ASSERT Earth by Volunteering, Donating & More
---
ASSERT is all about organizing help. We don't need to convince you to save your environment. You already want to help, we just need to guide you there. ASSERT Earth puts the main types of help we need into three buckets: Second Responders, Donations/Fundraising, and Organizers/Assistants. If you want to help out and your assistance doesn't fit into any of those categories, or you have any general questions feel free to contact us.

## Second Responders

Second Responders are the core of what we do, everything else exists to support these folks, and everything these folks do is to support our first responders and our environment. Second Responders are **not** firefighters and they are **not** licensed. You will be spending in smoky areas on dirt roads. This is work best suited for a healthy and mobile adult with a reliable vehicle.

## Donations & Fundraising



## Organizers & Assistants
